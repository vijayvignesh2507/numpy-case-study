# Setting up a Jupyter Notebook with NumPy

This repository provides a guide on setting up a Jupyter Notebook with the NumPy library for scientific computing in Python. The guide walks through the installation process, importing NumPy, creating NumPy arrays, performing mathematical operations on arrays, and saving and sharing Jupyter Notebooks.

# Installation
To get started, follow these steps to install Anaconda, which includes NumPy and the Jupyter Notebook app:

1. Go to the Anaconda website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. Download the installer for your operating system and run it.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the installer to complete the installation.

# Launching Jupyter Notebook
Once Anaconda is installed, you can launch the Jupyter Notebook app by following these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command and press Enter: **jupyter notebook**
3. This will open the Jupyter Notebook app in your default web browser.

# Creating a New Jupyter Notebook
To create a new Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "New" button in the top right corner of the Jupyter Notebook app.
2. Select "Python 3" from the dropdown menu.
3. This will create a new Jupyter Notebook with a single cell.

# Performing mathematical operations on NumPy arrays:

Performed mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, and matrix multiplication on NumPy arrays.
